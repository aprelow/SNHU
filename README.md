# SNHU programming c++
This repository showcases my work with programming languages, specifically C++. It contains projects that demonstrate my ability to write well-documented and readable code, design functional programs that meet industry standards, and use multiple programming languages to develop secure and efficient code.
In this assignment, I was presented with a text document that includes six cities and their average yearly temperature in Fahrenheit. The goal is to read that data, convert it to Celsius using the provided formula, and then write that new data to its own file.
